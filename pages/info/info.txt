Welcome to my analysis viewer! Here you will details and output plots from the various research projects I am involved with as part of my PhD.
I primarily use this site as an easy way to view output created on remote machines, and share these with other users.  <br/><br>

Please note that some projects are internal to ATLAS, and are denoted as such. These are not accesible to the public, sorry!
